Afte all the setup is done and pip install -r requirements.txt file is executed.
We will setup the folder for our project i.e. Housing

Data drift - Change in the distribution of the training data over the period of time which will affect the Model performance and degrrade the predictions

In the Housing folder-
we will create all the folders which will be needed for out project and inside it we will create __init__.py file in each of them which will be executed when we first call the class maintained in the __init__ file

now, from which folder should we start with the development work:
1 - Logger -  to collect all the logs from the code - so set up all the logs generated in our app execution and start recording them from the start as well to records the changes

2 - Exception - to record the Exception haandling at the before hand to get where actually the error is getting generated
